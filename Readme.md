# Pitch Types Clustering

## Overview
The goal of this task is to develop a framework which is capable of clustering pitch types based on pysical characteristics such as movement of the pitch, release point of the pitch, and so on. Exploratory data analysis, k-means clustering, and truncated SVD are applied to this project. This project is basically composed of three parts as follows:
1. Perform exploratory data analysis such as variable selection and unusual value detection
2. Cluster the pitch types using k-means clustering
3. Plot the position of the pitch types in 2D space using truncated SVD
